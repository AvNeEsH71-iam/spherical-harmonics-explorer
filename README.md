## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/spherical-harmonics-explorer.git
cd spherical-harmonics-explorer

# 2. Install dependencies  (tkinter ships with Python — no pip needed)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Run
python main.py
```

> **Linux note** — if you see `_tkinter` errors, install tkinter first:
> ```bash
> sudo apt-get install python3-tk
> ```

## 🌐 Modern Interactive Web Dashboard

An interactive React + Tailwind + Plotly dashboard is included in `dashboard.html`.

### Run it

```bash
# From project root
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8000/dashboard.html
```

### Included UI features

- Responsive dashboard grid with panel cards
- Click any panel to open expanded modal view with zoom animation
- Per-panel toolbar: Expand, Download, Reset (for 3D)
- Resizable cards (`resize: both`) for dynamic layout tuning
- Lazy loading for the heavy 3D panel
- Real / Imaginary / Absolute component toggle
- Sliders for dynamic `l` and `m`
- Hover tooltips on all plots

## 🔬 Physics Background

### Spherical Harmonics

Spherical harmonics Y_ℓ^m(θ, φ) are the **natural basis functions on a sphere** —
the sphere's analogue of Fourier modes on a circle.  Any smooth function on a
spherical surface can be expanded as:

```
f(θ,φ) = Σ_{ℓ=0}^∞  Σ_{m=−ℓ}^{ℓ}  f_{ℓm} Y_ℓ^m(θ,φ)
```

They arise as the angular solutions to **Laplace's equation** in spherical
coordinates and appear in electrostatics, quantum mechanics, and soft-matter
physics.

### Definition

```
Y_ℓ^m(θ,φ) = N_ℓ^m · P_ℓ^m(cos θ) · e^{imφ}

N_ℓ^m = √[ (2ℓ+1)/4π · (ℓ−|m|)!/(ℓ+|m|)! ]
```

### Indices

| Symbol | Name | Range | Physical meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| ℓ | degree | 0, 1, 2, … | total angular nodes |
| m | order | −ℓ … +ℓ | azimuthal oscillation count |

### Eigenvalue

```
∇²_Ω Y_ℓ^m = −ℓ(ℓ+1) · Y_ℓ^m
```

The factor ℓ(ℓ+1) appears in the bending energy of vesicle membranes,
the energy levels of hydrogen, and many other physical systems.

### Associated Legendre Polynomials

```
P_ℓ^m(x) = (−1)^m (1−x²)^{m/2} · d^m/dx^m  P_ℓ(x)

P_ℓ(x)   = 1/(2^ℓ ℓ!)  · d^ℓ/dx^ℓ  (x²−1)^ℓ    [Rodrigues]
```

### Why ℓ ≥ 2 for membrane physics?

| Mode | Energy | Reason excluded |
|---|---|---|
| ℓ = 0 | 0 (volume change) | Suppressed by incompressibility |
| ℓ = 1 | 0 (translation) | Rigid-body motion, no bending |
| ℓ ≥ 2 | κ · ℓ(ℓ+1)[ℓ(ℓ+1)−2] | **Physical deformation modes** |
